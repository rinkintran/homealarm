# Home Alarm System for the Raspberry Pi #

### What is this repository for? ###

This code is meant to run on the Raspberry Pi to recognize people who are close by. It detects movement, captures the picture, passes it through a neural net, and verifies the face. If not recognized, it will alert the owner of the device via email. This repository is built as a computer engineering senior project.
